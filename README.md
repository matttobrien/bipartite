# bipartite

My solution to determining if a graph is a bipartite or not in C++.

"A bipartite graph, also called a bigraph, is a set of graph vertices decomposed into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent." - Wolfram Alpha

I have uploaded 5 adjacency adjacency matrices for testing.

Steps to run:
## 1. Compile mysoultion.cpp
``` bash
g++ mysolution.cpp
```
## 2. Run, passing in filename of matrix
``` bash
./a.out matrix-082.txt
```
## 3. Done!
